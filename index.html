						PHP and MySQL are popular open-source technologies that are ideal for quickly
						developing database-driven Web applications. PHP is a powerful scripting 
						language designed to enable developers to create highly featured Web
						applications quickly, and MySQL is a fast, reliable database that integrates
						well with PHP and is suited for dynamic Internet-based applications.
					</p>
					
					<p class="specs">
						PHP and MySQL Web Development shows how to use these tools together to produce
						effective, interactive Web applications. It clearly describes the basics of the
						PHP language, explains how to set up and work with a MySQL database, and then shows
						how to use PHP to interact with the database and the server.
					</p>
					
					<p class="specs">
						This practical, hands-on book includes numerous examples that demonstrate common tasks
						such as authenticating users, constructing a shopping cart, generating PDF documents
						and images dynamically, sending and managing email, facilitatin user discussions,
						connecting to Web services using XML, and developing Web 2.0 applications with Ajax-based
						interactivity.
					</p>
					
					<p class="specs">

						revised, and expanded to cover developments in PHP 5 through version 5.3, such as
